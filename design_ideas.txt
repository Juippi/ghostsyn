for all elements:
 in tmp space, input first and output last
  -> can chain elements by just overlapping with one float val

 example:

 elem 1  elem 2

  [in]
  [tmp1]
  [tmp2]
  [out]  [in]
         [foo]
	 [out]

etc.

further optimization: distnce out - in always same (ok to waste some space here)
